RadeonLoad
=========

Just a quick fork to play around, please go to the main project page: https://github.com/clbr/radeontop

The aim is to have information of the GPU load to use in conky.
See wiki pages for how I use it.

Be aware that I'm an early beginner in c. This code may be unstable.

This repository is not maintained, I just keep it in case someone would be interested in picking some part of the code.

Requires root rights or other permissions to /dev/mem.

Supported cards
---------------

R600 and up, even Southern Islands should work fine. Requires the open radeon drivers.
