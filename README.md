=========

Just a quick fork to play around, please go to the main project page: https://github.com/clbr/radeontop

The aim is to have instant information of the GPU load to use in conky and on dynamic frequency changing for power saving.


Be aware that I'm an early beginner in c. This code may be unstable.


Requires root rights or other permissions to /dev/mem.
